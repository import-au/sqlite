<p>
If you create an asset without specifying a path to the SQLite database,
then a new SQLite database will be created which is unique to the asset
(located at <code>/opt/phantom/local_data/app_states/6eba2c65-cac0-4a5f-9e5d-3c79d2d90aeb/&lt;asset_id&gt;_db.dv</code>).
It is possible to import existing SQLite databases as well.
Copy it over to the Phantom OVA, and set the "Path to the SQLite database" to the path of this file.
Ensure that the user phantom-worker has read and write access to this file.
It is recommended that you place any imported database into the app's state directory.
